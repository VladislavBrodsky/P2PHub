## 🛠 Development Standards

### Backend (Python)
- Use **Ruff** for linting and formatting.
- Ensure all new services and endpoints have type hints.
- Run `python scripts/verify_imports.py` before pushing.

### Frontend (React/TS)
- Use **ESLint** and **Prettier** (via Vite config).
- Prefer functional components and hooks.
- Use `lucide-react` for icons and `framer-motion` for animations.

## 🧪 CI/CD

Every Pull Request triggers:
- **Backend CI**: Linting and import verification.
- **Frontend CI**: Linting and type checking.

Please ensure all checks pass before requesting a review.
